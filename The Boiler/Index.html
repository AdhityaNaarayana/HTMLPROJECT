                <h1>The Boiler</h1>
                <p>The Boiler is a seafood joint that serves up fresh seafood known as seafood boil together with strong bold sauces which are infused with both local and western spices. It aims to ignite your five senses by bringing back the harmonious spirit of fresh tasty seafood and unassuming dining atmosphere all under one roof. 

                    In 2008, the owner, a banker-turned restaurateur, was introduced to a seafood boil restaurant in LA by his relatives where it was love at first sight. The owner was intrigued by the rich Cajun culture and was determined to share the joy of this communal experience back to his family and friends. After countless backyard crab feasts, he finally created the flavours that boasts a fusion of Asian and American spices and the rest is history. This secret recipe which comprises of 11 different spices and ingredients still remains a highly kept secret, which the owner himself hand-packed them every night after the restaurant closes.</p>
